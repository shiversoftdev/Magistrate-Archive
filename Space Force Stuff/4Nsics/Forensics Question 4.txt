Forensics Question 4

    - Please place your answer on the line marked ANSWER:
    - Do not add leading or trailing non-whitespace characters

During your security audit, a member on your team pointed out a suspicious php file in the root of the web server. 
Because the contents of the file have been obscured, your team has decided to analyze it further. When using this php script through a browser, you are prompted to enter a password to execute it's underlying code. 

However, the password seems to be hardcoded into the php file itself. 

What is the password required to execute the code?

Example: acorn1
